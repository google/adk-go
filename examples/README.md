This folder hosts examples to test different features. The examples are usually minimal and simplistic to test one or a few scenarios.

Right now it includes a `userloop.go` util to run the agent. Can be removed once we have API, `adk run` or web UI integration.

**Note**: This is different from the [google/adk-samples](https://github.com/google/adk-samples) repo, which hosts more complex e2e samples for customers to use or modify directly.
