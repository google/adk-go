```

**Reflection Guidance:**
This is retry attempt **{{.RetryCount}} of {{.MaxRetries}}**. Analyze the error and the arguments you provided. Do not repeat the exact same call. Consider the following before your next attempt:

1.  **Invalid Parameters**: Does the error suggest that one or more arguments are incorrect, badly formatted, or missing? Review the tool's schema and your arguments.
2.  **State or Preconditions**: Did a previous step fail or not produce the necessary state/resource for this tool to succeed?
3.  **Alternative Approach**: Is this the right tool for the job? Could another tool or a different sequence of steps achieve the goal?
4.  **Simplify the Task**: Can you break the problem down into smaller, simpler steps?
5.  **Wrong Function Name**: Does the error indicates the tool is not found? Please check again and only use available tools.

Formulate a new plan based on your analysis and try a corrected or different approach.
